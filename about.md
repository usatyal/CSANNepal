## INTRODUCTION

CSAN was established to ensure that cancer is detected early in Nepal and those
patients get the best possible treatment so that the ‘cure’ is attained with least social,
emotional and financial burden. CSAN is working together with Kathmandu Cancer
Center, a comprehensive cancer center which is in Bhaktapur, Nepal.


## BACKGROUND

Incidence of Cancer is increasing in developing countries like Nepal as per the World
Health Organization. Along with the increasing incidence of cancer, awareness about
cancer is also gradually increasing. Cervical Cancer, Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer and
Cancers of Head and Neck are the most common cancers encountered in Nepal. It has
been noted that most of these cancers are very well curable if detected early.

With no substantial government plans for awareness and screening of cancer in Nepal,
patients often come with extensive disease - that too when it could have been cured if it
had been detected early.

The outcome of Cancer treatment depends not only on the stage of cancer on
detection, but also on the dedication of the treatment centers. Kathmandu Cancer
Center has been acclaimed to be one of the most dedicated cancer centers in Nepal.
